OK SO, this has basically been like 70% recoded to actually work in GM13 and I'm actually in the process of improving the original programming even after being ported, so please bear in mind that THIS ADDON IS /REALLY UNFINISHED/ AND YOU WILL COME ACROSS WEIRD SHIT

PLEASE, PLEASE do not repost this on the workshop, github, etc.  This is a work in progress in its current state and I would prefer to release it when it's completely done and ready for the best experience for everyone.

This doesn't include the Scav DM mapping tools or Scav DM, those will come later

Thanks <3
