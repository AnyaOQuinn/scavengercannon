--Ghor's todo list
--I'll work on this as much as I can myself but some of this is a bit obtuse and I don't know what he could be referring to --Anya

--important

	--be sure the convar for scav projectile life is working
	--chargeattacks don't work properly when the weapon is being forced to refrain from holstering?
	--SPECTATORS CAN FLASHLIGHT
	--see about making getmodelinfo available on the client, using CreateClientModel instead of ents.Create("prop_physics")

	--get rid of blue death cloud on props that die normally
	--frozen status should cause phys objects to stop moving
	--toggleable visor that highlights objects that can be enabled with context menu, shows what players are carrying in slot 1 (name? + icon)
	---offset BHG impact with the normal of the hit surface
	
	--SCAVENGER DEATHMATCH	

	--improved team-join menu, show brief summary of subgamemode (could be a vgui panel intead of just a simple string, allowing for images), show on startup
	--per-firemode kill messages?
		--notifications need to be bigger
		--give gprojectiles a fake "inflictorname" the PlayerDeath gamemode hook can take
		--rockets and other projectiles should be easy enough
		--if the mode is hitscan simply getting the current mode of the scavgun will be enough
	--map/setting voting menu for scav DM
	--help tab on the menu?
	--add particle flames to scav_furnace
		--add lights inside the furnace as a visual cue for the closing sequence
		--make red/blue bases more clear
		--extend the bases?
			--unopenable doors (of the blast variety?)
		--more handrails?
		--more pipes/signs?
		--brighter env_projectedtexture?
	--more user-friendly mapping tools, maybe a gamemode?
		--ents should highlight, selecting an entity with a certain weapon/tool will open a menu
		--should be based on keyvalues/inputs
		--targetnames
		--teleporter ents?
	--model for weapon locker (bookshelf + vertical sliding door)
	--instead of auto-draining items from the scav gun, give the collection points their own menus. This will work great with the new item system.
	--healing station/weapon station?
		--weapon stations are weapons that will always be there but appear for the given player only once per life?
		--combine together like the shops in dead space?
		--protective bubbles around these areas?
	--option to remove all physics props on map start or leave them be
	--maybe make use of noscav props to make scav_mars nicer
	
	
--not as important
	--use more decals
	--improve sonic boom interactions (water, explosion)
	--see about ice chunks stuck in surfaces from the gas?,
	--see about laser sights as an upgrade/option,
	--there should be different magnitudes of the prop spawn particle effect
		--rings and lightning?
	--use stencil buffer to create outlines around objects the player is looking at that he can pick up
	--make sure the music system for scav dm isn't broken or something, it seems to like playing the same song over and over again..
	--make spectator mode more substantial, get rid of useless HUD elements and make important ones visible
	--frag counter at the top for team dm?
	--flash of light at the start of a new round
		--teleportation spawn effect?
	--clean up arrows, maybe make the pinning/ragdolling code a scavdata function
	--make detonators
	--antlion guards should give bugbait, among other things
	--make the scope easier to use, available on more weapons, update tip
	--replace self.Owner:EmitSound with self.Weapon:EmitSound
